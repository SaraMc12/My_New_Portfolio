        I was first approached about being an Illustrator by my friend and fellow Second City Alum who wanted to create a positive and relatable role model for her infant son. 
        It was a challenge on a technical level since it was the first time I had ever used a Cintiq tablet to do my art, on top of that I had to learn a new digital art program when my favorite program, Photoshop stopped working well with my new tablet due to a new update. It was also a challenge artistically as I wanted to make sure I was creating a visual story that represented Palestine accurately. Luckily, I had taken some Arabic in college and, although rusty, was able to recreate the signs in Ramallah market that both surprised and delighted her.  
        I ended up doing a lot of research educating myself on Palestine to make sure I was doing my best to represent her story visually. 
        Especially when creating the art for traditional objects like the kufiyah or a Tatreez as they are so intricate in design. Laith the Lion has already sold out on Amazon once and can be purchased in several local Chicago bookstores as well as NY, Boston and Jordan.
